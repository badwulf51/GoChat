# GoChat

For a class project I have been tasked with making a web app chat bot with go. For my reasearch into this project I looked up many different ways to actually code the chat bot itself as in my own opinion it is the most challenging part of the project. The best method I found was using regullar expression. As seen in many chat bots online, devs tend to give them a personality of a popular pop culture character, due to this I have decided to model my bots personality off "Monokuma" from the game series "Danganronpa". Having a personailty like this brings a certain uniquiness to the bot and will make its responses less boring. I have used regex to capture various responses and keywords enterted by the user, once the user enters one of these key words the bot will output a response that fits the word or sentace entered. If the user enters a string that is not captured by the bot, the bot will output a random response. Some of the random responses that the bot outputs I have called "Converstation starters", for example, if the user enters a string that is not captured by the bot, the bot will reply with a random string that says "Gee do you kiss your mother with that mouth!?"which in turn tempts the user to make his/her next string feture the word "mother" which is captured by the bot already.
